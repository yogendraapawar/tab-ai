<h1 align="center">TabSense</h1>

<p align="justify">
TabSense is a Chrome extension that helps researchers and knowledge workers manage information overload while browsing. Like a personal research assistant, it transforms messy, tab-filled sessions into an organized, searchable knowledge base ‚Äî clustering related content, summarizing key ideas, and enabling natural language queries. By turning chaotic browsing into structured insight, TabSense tackles one of the web‚Äôs most persistent problems: too many tabs, too little clarity.
